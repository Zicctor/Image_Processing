## 1. What does this program do?

This program performs the following image processing tasks:

1. **Load an Image**: Reads an image from the specified file path.
2. **Noise Removal**: Applies a Gaussian blur to the image to reduce noise.
3. **Grayscale Conversion**: Converts the original image to a grayscale image.
4. **Edge Detection**: Uses a Laplacian operator on the grayscale image to detect edges.
5. **Display Result**: Displays the processed image in a window.

Each step is crucial for enhancing the image and preparing it for further analysis or display.
